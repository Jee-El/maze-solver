# maze-solver

# About

I made this project for two reasons :

- It is the language taught at my school so I decided to go ahead and play around with it.

- It is going to be the topic of my team's school project.

# Features :

- It is possible to solve any maze (duh!) as long as :

  - A solution exists

  - It follows the following format :

    - Walls/Obstacles are represented with a `#`, everything else is represented with an empty space.
   
- Both Depth-First-Algorithm and Breadth-First-Algorithm are implemented and available for use.

- By uncommenting some parts of the code (Have a look at ./maze_solver.py), you can see a live version of the solving process.
