# maze-solver

# About

I made this project for two reasons :

- It is the language taught at my school so I decided to go ahead and play around with it.

- It is going to be presented in a school project my team and I are working on.

# Features :

- It is possible to solve any maze (duh!) as long as :

  - A solution exists

  - It follows the following format :

    - Walls/Obstacles are represented with a `#`
    
    - The start and end points are marked, respectively, with `A` and `B`
    
    - Everything else is represented with an empty space.
   
- It has these algorithms implemented and available for use :

  - Depth-First-Search
 
  - Breadth-First-Search
  
  - Greedy Best-First-Search

# Requirements to run this project :

- Python (I tested the project on python 3.9 and 3.11)

- PyGame

# How To Use :

- Press enter to progress by one move.

- Press escape to jump straight to the solution/end.
